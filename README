text2semaphore

This is a Google App Engine (GAE) python application I wrote to take a string of
alphanumeric+underscore characters and convert all the letters to their ICAO
spelling alphabet (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO_spelling_alphabet)
telephony equivalent word.  Numbers and the underscore are returned
unconverted.

The intended UI for using this was via browser URL bar (awesome bar, whatever
the cool kids are calling it these days).  You enter whatever you want
expanded as the pathname of the URL and the application returns the
telephony equivalent of the pathname in the body of the response.

There is an HTML form with some rudimentary javascript automation to handle
the process of driving the URL pathname rewriting for those who are more
comfortable with using an HTML form.

Finally, programmatic access is provided by doing a GET on the pathname
you want translated with an Accept: header that indicates text/plain is the
preferred (or only) format wanted.  In this case, the entire response body
will be just the telephony equivalent with a space between each
word/number/underscore, and an Content-Type header of text/plain.

The code should be easily adaptable to pretty much any other python web
framework.  If you really feel a need to have your own GAE instance of it,
come up with your own favicon.ico and application name, and have at it.

My interest in doing this was because I work on travel industry
software and we are continually working with confirmation numbers and "record
locators" and communicating them to others.  Everybody in the industry uses
their own mnemonic words that they adapt when they have temporary brain lock.
I can never remember a good set of mnemonic words for letters in a rush, so I
wanted to see if having this would help me.

The code is released under an MIT license.  Have fun if you really think it
has use.  Patches/suggestions welcome.
